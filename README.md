# WESE Website

### Using:
* HTML
* CSS

This is a simple website created as a test and pratice to my online course on Ustacky.
At the point of creation, the aim is to practice the efficient use of HTML and CSS to 
create a responsive website.

The index page of this website is not linked to the other page, except when using the 
signup button that the top right corner.

## Learning Objective
My learning objective is to learn to be a **Full Stack Python Developer** but that change
because I realise I can do more that just learn Python.

**Note:** that this project is not yet completed and shall be concluded soon as 
I have now set to learn and become a **Full Stack Software Engineer**

The most completed part of this project is the Signups' Pages and the Thank You Page.

*Have fun looking around*
